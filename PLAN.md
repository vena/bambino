# bambino — Lazy connections and API consistency

**Important:** Before starting any phase, read this document in its entirety. Read the `README.md` cover to cover. Understand what this library does and who it's for. Do not apply generic software engineering heuristics without grounding them in the project's actual goals.

**Pre-release:** This library has not been released. All API changes are on the table. Do not preserve backward compatibility for external consumers — only for tests and the CLI within the same crate, and only when the phase specifies it.

**When completing a phase:** Update this PLAN.md marking the phase complete. Update the completed phases summary, strictly including **only** what is necessary to inform clean sessions implementing the next phases which cannot be learned from the code itself.

## Phases 1–4: Complete

Phases 1–4 migrated `PrinterClient` to lazy connections for both MQTT and FTPS, with symmetric APIs for both protocols.

**Decisions informing future phases:**

- **Consuming builders change type params; non-consuming builders return `Self`.** `.with_timer()` and `.with_ftps()` consume `self` because they change type parameters. `.with_mqtt_port()` and `.with_ftps_port()` return `Self`. Phase 7's camera builder must follow the same convention.
- **`ensure_*()` is the lazy connection pattern.** `ensure_mqtt()` and `ensure_ftps()` short-circuit on `Some`, otherwise connect lazily. `ensure_ftps()` uses `.take()` to consume `ftps_config`, so reconnection requires a new `PrinterClient`. Phase 7 should consider whether camera's persistent streaming nature needs a different reconnection story.
- **Each protocol's TLS config is independent.** FTPS may need `force_tls_1_2` (model quirk) while MQTT does not. Phase 7's camera TLS may also differ — don't assume a shared connector.
- **CLI storage now routes through `PrinterClient`.** Phase 7's camera CLI command should follow the same pattern rather than constructing protocol clients directly.

## Phase 5: Documentation

### Problem

After phases 1–4, the `PrinterClient` API has changed significantly. The doc examples and README show the old pre-connected API.

### Changes

**`src/lib.rs` doc example** — Update to show lazy connection via `PrinterClient::new()` with a `TokioSecureConnector`.

**README "Connect" section** — Replace the 6-line connection plumbing with the new builder API. Show both construction paths (lazy and pre-connected via `from_mqtt()`).

**README "File transfer" section** — Show `PrinterClient` with `.with_ftps()` as the primary example. Keep direct `BambuFtpsClient` usage in a "Direct protocol access" note.

**README raw access** — Document `mqtt().await?` and `storage().await?` as async `Result`-returning accessors.

**CLAUDE.md** — Update the "Non-Obvious Type Decisions" section for `PrinterClient` to reflect the new constructor patterns, lazy connection semantics, builder methods, and `Conn: SecureConnect` type parameter.

### Verification

```sh
cargo build && cargo test && cargo clippy && cargo doc --no-deps
```

Verify `cargo doc` produces no warnings for broken doc links.

## Phase 6: CLI dependencies leak into library `tokio` feature

### Problem

`crossterm` and `env_logger` are optional deps gated behind `tokio` in `Cargo.toml`, but neither is used in library code — only by `src/bin/bambino-cli/`. The CLI shipping in the same crate is intentional (README: "Ships as a binary in the same crate"), but the dep gating means any external consumer using `bambino` with default features pulls in a terminal manipulation library and a concrete log sink.

### Investigation

- Confirm no library code imports `crossterm` or `env_logger` (already verified).
- Evaluate options: (a) gate both behind a dedicated `cli` feature not implied by `tokio`, or (b) accept the current state since external consumers are not the primary use case yet at 0.1.0.
- If (a), verify that `cargo build --bin bambino-cli` still works when `cli` is enabled and that `cargo build --lib` no longer pulls in `crossterm`/`env_logger`.

### Fix

Apply if warranted. Verify `cargo build`, `cargo build --no-default-features --features alloc --lib`, and `cargo test` all pass.

## Phase 7: Camera integration in `PrinterClient`

### Problem

`PrinterClient` has no camera awareness. The CLI's camera command bypasses `PrinterClient` and uses `BambuBinaryCameraStream` directly, duplicating connection logic that `PrinterClient` already owns.

### Background

Bambu printers use two camera protocols (determined by `model.quirks().camera_protocol()`):

- **Binary JPEG (port 6000, A1/P1 series)** — `src/camera/binary.rs` provides `BambuBinaryCameraStream`, a complete client that authenticates and streams JPEG frames over TLS. Persistent streaming connection.
- **RTSPS (port 322, X1/X2/H2/P2S series)** — `src/camera/rtsps.rs` provides helper utilities only (URL generation, proxy URI rewriting, timestamp correction). No RTSP client — consumers integrate with external media frameworks.

### Design questions to answer first

- **Streaming vs request/response** — Binary JPEG is a persistent stream, unlike FTPS's connect-operate-disconnect pattern. Does the `.with_ftps()` + lazy `storage()` pattern work for a long-lived stream?
- **Two protocols, one slot?** A printer uses either binary JPEG or RTSPS, never both. Single `camera()` accessor returning an enum, or separate methods? RTSPS has no connection state.
- **Type parameter impact** — Can camera reuse the existing `Conn: SecureConnect` connector, or does camera TLS differ from MQTT's?
- **Lazy connection** - like MQTT and FTPS, camera connection should be lazy and not required to instantiate a PrinterClient.

### Scope

Answer the design questions based on the current codebase, then write a concrete implementation plan. Do not start implementation without a plan.
